#Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:print("Hello, World!")  -- Single Line Comment

Or by creating a python file, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
python 'A:\\Ashish-GIT\\Python_Training\\Python-Learnings\\Docs\\HandsOn-Labs\\1 HelloWorld.py'

Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Valid Syntax

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

InValid Syntax


if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

"""
print("Hello, World!")
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
